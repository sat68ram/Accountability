Why this structure is React/Tailwind-friendly later

When you’re ready to flip to React + Tailwind, you can:

Initialize Vite (or CRA) in the same repo

src/react/main.tsx, src/react/App.tsx etc.

Gradually copy markup from src/screens/*.html into React components:

CompanyVision.tsx

TimelineDial.tsx

OKRTable.tsx

Replace class names with Tailwind utilities incrementally, or use the existing CSS while you transition.

Eventually, index-shell.html ? index.html for Vite, and React Router replaces screen-loader.js.

You get a clean migration path:
static ? hybrid ? full React/Tailwind, without throwing away any work.
